# Armadillo

Resurrection! Armadillo was the main UI for Google Fuchsia from around May 2017 to December 2018. It was removed in a commit with the message being "[Armadillo fainted!](https://fuchsia-review.googlesource.com/c/topaz/+/235313)".

The UI was a card based interface with the status bar being in the middle of the screen rather than the top. Running applications are stored at the top while the launcher at the bottom has a search bar type input also letting you pull up and find your applications. The search bar was used to launch fuchsia applications, such as the spinning cube test, and also launching web urls to chromium.
